== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I access my wiki home page? =

http://yourwebsite.com/wiki/frontpage/

Once you activate UserPress, a wiki page called "Frontpage" is automatically created. This will serve as the main page of your WordPress wiki (http://yourwebsite.com/wiki/frontpage/). 

Also, if you try to access "http://yourwebsite.com/wiki/" UserPress will automatically forward you to the frontpage.


= How can I post wiki articles? =

You can post wiki articles by visiting "http://yourwebsite.com/wiki/?action=create". (You can post wiki articles using wp-admin under the "Wiki" sidebar menu item.)
